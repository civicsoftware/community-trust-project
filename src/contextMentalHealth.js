  title: "Mental Health & Addiction Medicaid Clients Served",
  summary:
    "These data represent the count of Healthshare Medicaid clients served through Multnomah County Health Department Mental Health and Addiction Services in Calendar Year 2017 (division is now called Behavioral Health as of July 1, 2020), per the World Health Organization definition, aggregated by census tract. (source: Economic Mobility Dashboard Data/Variables)",
  dataType: "Dataset",
  dateRange: "1/1/2017 - 12/31/2017",
  subComponentOf: "Systemic Isolation Marginalization",
  includedIn: "Economic Mobility Dashboard",
  relatedTo:
    "Other variables considered in 'Systemic Isolation Margination': Evictions, Limited/No Internet, Person Crimes",
  successes:
    'The HSRI report identifies several existing ongoing efforts at Multnomah County: "The Behavioral Health Draft Work Plan of the Oregon Health Policy Board includes consideration of many of the issues discussed in this analysis, including integration, financing, care coordination, workforce issues, evidence-based practice, cultural best practice, and childrenâ€™s behavioral health issues including meeting the needs of children in foster care. Stakeholders at the local and state levels appear to be in agreement that the goals of system reforms should be to maintain the positive gains from past efforts while addressing continued issues such as physical and behavioral health integration, health equity, supporting the social determinants of health, and outcomes-driven quality improvement."',
  challenges:
    'The HSRI report identifies barriers, in particular for communities of color, to accessing services at the county. In particular, communities of color and immigrants lack access to culturally responsive services that go beyond language translation, and providers with a deep understanding of "historical trauma, microaggressions, and racism." The report identifies and discusses both overrepresentation and underrepresentation based on race and ethnicity in the public behavioral health system. As next steps, the report identifies three high priority recommendations: (1) "Engage in ongoing dialogue with service users and their families and other stakeholders to ensure a shared and actionable vision for the mental health system."; (2) "Establish a director-level lived experience leadership position"; (3) "Integrate and analyze data on funding and services to support system improvements."',

The dataset of Medicaid Clients Served may undercount behavioral health service utilization by persons with Medicaid.",

The document aimed to provide (i) an inventory of all mental health services offered by County and partners (including capacity for culturally specific services), (ii) a catalog of connections between all services in (i), (iii) a picture of funding and reimbursement flows, and (iv) identification of gaps between community need and existing mental health services. Along with a quantitative component and review of the system, part of the research involved qualitative interviews of 139 stakeholders (including people with lived experience of the mental health system), community listening sessions (159 individuals), as well as online feedback."
